        <p>It is a period of civil war.
          <br>Rebel spaceships, striking
          <br>from a hidden base, have won
          <br>their first victory against
          <br>the evil Galactic Empire.
          <br>
          <br>During the battle, Rebel
          <br>spies managed to steal secret
          <br>plans to the Empire's
          <br>ultimate weapon, the DEATH
          <br>STAR, an armored space
          <br>station with enough power
          <br>to destroy an entire planet.

          <br>starship, custodian of the
          <br>stolen plans that can save her
          <br>people and restore
          <br>freedom to the galaxy....</p>
